								<h3>R'Budget</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R'Budget is a budgeting web app developed to help college students keep track of their expenses. Users can deposit and withdraw from their monthly budget and these actions are recorded in their Statements. The Analytics section visually represents how much money the User is spending on different categories. If the User is saving up for an item, they can use the Goals page to track their savings. <br />
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I developed the sections: Monthly Money Statements, Goals, and Spending Recommendations. I was also responsible for testing and verifying other team member's code. I used Scrum methodology to manage four team sprints and wrote user stories with the assigned story points correlating to each task. The web app is built with Firestore, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS.

								<h3>Space Militia - Level 1</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Space Militia is a first-person shooter with puzzle solving elements. The game is built using the Unity engine and its scripts are written in C#.  The first level takes place in a rural setting, where the player must defend their village, find, and board their ship. <br />
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The player must save their farm animals before venturing out of the village and fight off alien enemies to proceed through the level. The player encounters a space ship and must complete ship launch tasks before flying off into space. I enjoyed designing the level and creating all the puzzles in Level 1. I also decorated the world, worked on the UI, and animated the gates.

								<h3>Space Militia - Level 2</h3>
							</header>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second level the player must recapture the space station from the aliens to save their village. The player will solve puzzles to discover that the aliens are stealing the chickens to use as organic energy to power their engines and generators. Then the player will fight off the aliens to retake the space station and save their village! In this level, I built the first section and its puzzles that take place before the player falls into the trash compactor. </p>

								<h3> BeLively</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BeLively is a subscription-based business model design that focuses on online at home workouts by professional instructors. BeLively's Users can attend live classes and watch workout videos from their favorite instructors from the comfort of home. The Instructor can use BeLively to reach their audience online and can upload videos daily. Students and Instructors have a profile where they can update their user information. Other User features include a health tracker, the ability to rent equipment, and a monthly 1-on-1 meeting with an Instructor. <br />
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I developed separate sign in, sign up, and profile pages for both the student and instructor, helped create database layout and added functionality categories for the instructor's videos. The web app uses Firestore as a Database and is written in Javascript.

								<h3>8-Puzzle Solver with A* Algorithm</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program uses an informed path search algorithm using different variations of the A* algorithm to determine the path of least cost, such as least distance traveled, from starting point to goal. The A* algorithm is the fastest search algorithm for any kind of given heuristic as it must expand a minimum of A* nodes. The different types of variations which can solve the eight-puzzle are uniform cost search, A* with the Misplaced Tile heuristic, and A* with Euclidean Distance heuristic. <br />
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program will display the expanding state with its nodes and show the values of g(n)=total cost sum from starting node to current node, and h(n)=cost from current node to goal state, for each state the algorithm finds. When the goal state is found then the program will display “Goal !!!” and state how many nodes were expanded as well as the maximum number of nodes in the queue at a time before terminating. This project is written using C++.

								<h3>Hotel Database Management System</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project models a hotel database management system using PostgreSQL and Java. This system can track information about different hotels, such as the rooms they own, the maintenance of those rooms, the managers they employ, the bookings their customers make, and information about the customers that use the hotel services.<br />
							   	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I created UI using Java with data validation and error checking to allow for user friendly database queries and overall improved user experience.

								<h3>AR Sandbox</h3>
							</header>
							<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AR SandBox is a tool for learning about geological land forms and topographic maps that students built for the Geology Department using software from Dr. Oliver Kreylos at UC Davis. The project involved setting up the Sandbox to work as an automated functioning system. The system has a Kinect and projector system that work together to create an accurate 3D map. In addition, the system was also automated so that it would run when powered on instead of having the User login to the system and turn on the software. The table was built from scratch in order to be cut to specific dimensions and save on costs.   </p>
